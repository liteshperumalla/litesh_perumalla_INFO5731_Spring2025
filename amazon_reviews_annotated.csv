This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible. Pricey but worth it.Read more,84,489,4.833333333333333,27,0,1,0,this along tempered glass screen lens protector kept brand new iphone 16 pro max pristine condition magsafe work perfectly just wished protected better design protruding quite far border required keep hitting surface very put take slim profile crystal clear aesthetic all button easily accessible pricey worth itread,Neutral
"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option. It is a little pricey, but there are more expensive options out there.Read more",206,1096,4.325242718446602,94,0,0,4,ive tried iphones either stiff color fade time these hold well every day use silicone give nice tactile without feeling sticky accumulating anythingit protects raised lip back worry setting back even though button covered something didnt press due softness silicone well put remove need snug protects sidesthe complaint make many color gray niceif youre looking nice looking slippery hand protects screen scratch raised edge touch surface sitting definitely great option little pricey expensive option thereread,Positive

"I think it's safe to say apple knows it's products the best, this iPhone 16 Pro Max Case has been awesome, right of the the box it snaps on with little to no effort leaves the phone essentially as close as your going to get it it's original form factor (for being in a protective case ) offers up a very comfortable fit in your hand while giving you a much better grip on it with your day to day use. The MagSafe feature continues to work perfectly with this case with no noticeable downgrade in the magnets ability to grab on to and secure your gadgets. It offers up full protection and use for its Camera Control Button as well no cut outs like alot of the after market brands. The case is easy to clean doesn't leave finger print smudges and comes in a variety of different color options. I gave it a four out of five because as far as cases go I dont think this one provides you the same over all protection as some of the more expensive options on the market can but I am 100 percent satisfied with my purchase decision and have had absolutely no issues at all with this caseRead more",210,1089,4.190476190476191,100,0,2,4,think safe say know product best iphone 16 pro max awesome right box snap little effort leaf essentially close going get original form factor protective offer comfortable fit hand giving much better grip day day use magsafe feature continues work perfectly noticeable downgrade magnet ability grab secure gadget offer full use control button well cut out alot market brand clean leave finger print smudge come variety different color option gave four five far go think provides expensive option market 100 percent satisfied purchase decision absolutely issue caseread,Positive

"I always buy a least one apple case whenever I purchase a new iPhone. The microfiber inserts are why I like them the most, coupled with the perfect “thickness” for the rubber coating on the outside. (Most other silicone cases are just ever so slightly too thick and bulky) this case also has the capture button enclosed completely so there’s not some enormous cutout on the side of your phone. they are pricey but they always seem to hold up for me.

"I shopped for a week or two for a good case. I invested in the 16 Pro Max and was/am very nervous about protecting it (it ain’t cheap!!) This one doesn’t feel like one of the paramilitary type covers but it does seem to do the absolute minimum while protecting the cameras and screen. It seems optimized to me, if I had to describe it, to keep the profile as small as possible and to protect the phone. It’s a large phone, a very large phone, so keeping the case small seems big to me. And one of the biggest sell points for me was the rubbery/grippery feel. It’s easy to keep in-hand; and we all know how those incidental, accidental drops happen. I haven’t dropped it yet, and while I’m still a bit nervous, I’ve read enough reviews I feel comfortable with the case. It DOES feel great and keeps the phone as small as possible.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time.

This case along with tempered glass screen and lens protectors have kept my brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max in pristine condition. MagSafe works perfectly. Just wished this case protected the camera lenses better. The design of this phone has the camera lenses protruding quite far so more of a border is required to keep it from hitting surfaces. Very easy to put on and take off. Slim profile and crystal clear for aesthetics. All buttons are easily accessible.

"I’ve tried other cases for my iPhones and they are either too stiff or the color fades over time. These cases hold up well to every day use and the silicone gives it a nice tactile feel without feeling sticky or accumulating anything.It protects the camera lenses with the raised “lip” on the back so I don’t have to worry about setting my phone down on its back. Even though the buttons are all covered (something I didn’t like on other phone cases) they are still easy to press due to the softness of the silicone. The case fits well and is easy to put on and remove if need be, but fits snug and protects the phone on all sides.The only complaint I have is that they don’t make them in very many colors, but the gray one I have is nice.If you’re looking for a nice looking case that doesn’t feel slippery in your hands and protects the screen and camera lenses from scratches (by having a small raised edge so they don’t touch the surface that the phone is sitting on) then this case is definitely a great option.
